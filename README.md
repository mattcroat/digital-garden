## 🌱 Digital Garden

This is a digital garden using:

- ⚛️ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- ✍ [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (JSX in Markdown) using [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) that lets you write [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and import components, such as interactive charts and embed them within your content
- 😎 [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) for **CSS** because it works out of the box with **Next.js** and resembles a **single file component** experience like in **Vue**, or **Svelte**
